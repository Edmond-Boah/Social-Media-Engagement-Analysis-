# Social Media Engagement Analysis Dashboard  

This project analyzes 100 social media posts across three major platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter/X) and five content types (images, videos, carousels, text, and polls).  
It demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, model, and visualize data to uncover actionable insights.  
It delivers a detailed analysis of social media engagement, exploring how content type, platform, and posting time affect engagement. The findings are presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
